# 1-1-multi-tenant-onboarding

This story consolidates and completes the foundational multi-tenant onboarding flow. It encompasses the following legacy implementation artifacts:

- **1.1 Tenant Provisioning System**: Core infrastructure for creating and managing tenant environments.
- **1.2 User Authentication with Firebase**: Integration of Firebase Auth for secure user identity management.
- **1.4 Multi-tenant Data Isolation**: Implementation of security rules and data structures to ensure strict isolation between tenants.
- **1.6 Center Registration with Google OAuth**: Steamlining the onboarding process using Google OAuth for center administrators.

The combined functionality provides a seamless experience for new centers to register, authenticate, and begin using the platform within a secure, isolated tenant environment.
