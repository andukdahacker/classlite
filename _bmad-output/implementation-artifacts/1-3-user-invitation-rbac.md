# 1-3-user-invitation-rbac

This story consolidates and completes the user invitation and access control system. It encompasses the following legacy implementation artifacts:

- **1.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Definition and enforcement of user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) and their respective permissions.
- **1.5 User Invitation System**: The workflow for administrators to invite new users to their tenant and assign appropriate roles.

The combined functionality allows for secure and efficient scaling of tenant organizations by enabling administrators to invite team members with granular access controls.
